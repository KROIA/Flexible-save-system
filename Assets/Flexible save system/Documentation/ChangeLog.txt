~ Objects ID generation changed after reloading the same scene. Objects now hold the same ID as before.
~ Loading a savegame only when the savegame exists, preventing delete of instantiated objects if the loaded safegame is not existant and therefore empty


V01.02.03:

  The SaveableEntityManager now also keeps track of all deleted objects so that they are not saved again.

V01.01.00:
SaveLoadSystem:
+ Delete(); for SaveLoadSystem, this will remove the current selected save File.

SaveableEntity:

  This is the case, if you copy an instantiated object.
